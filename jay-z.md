## Notes

### Thursday July 15 1920 10PM

A fellow alumni at Cornell has informed me that a professor there requires my services. We are to meet at a bar, Small's Paradise, in Harlem on 135th St. 

Admitted by the doorman. Directed to a table in the back of the club. Food is genuine and imported. Swankest place in town, plenty of bribes keep it open.    

We are seated at a table where a man is sitting at a table, but not the man I expect. He tells us the person we are supposed to be meeting is not present.

Fail to notice anything about the man watching the jazz band or spot anything hidden.

A man carrying a shiny trumpet enters the room. He seems to want to get to the band but we are on the way. He walks up to the stranger we are seated with. 

Notice the trumpter, named Turner, had some drinks. Jeffery asks turner to play something.

Announcement: "Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor is here..." New song, dead man stomp. New piece is a hit.

I notice a small rat-like man has entered the room. Not sure if he's headed towards us or will pass by. Midway through the tribute to the mayor, the stranger moves forward.

Rat-faced man blows the head off the stranger.

Jeffery, his goon, and I chase after the man outside. He gets in a Packard (car) and drive off. Jeffery takes a shot at the car. Someone pops up in the car and sprays a Thompson SMG. I get shot in the leg.

I do first aid on myself to stop the bleeding.

We go back inside, the stranger gets up and staggers out of a club even though he has a hole in his head. As he leaves the club, screams mark his progress. 

The undead stranger keeps moaning "Joey". After he goes outside, cops arrive, and we go with Jeffery back to Comet Pizzeria. The goon

After arriving at Pizzeria, the goon comes back and gives us a card:

Morgan and Dupree Funeral Home / 145th St Harlem. Serving families of African descent since 1851. 

We stay the night at Jeffery the Egg's place. 

### Friday July 16 1920 9AM

I wake up and go to work, cheerfully helping others. 

Unbeknownst to me, Howard calls his Cornell professor friend. The professor says the undead man was "moved by the music". 

The goon recognizes the rat-faced man as Joey Larson from Archie "The Boss" Bonato's gang.

Howard and Jeffery pick me up. We go get breakfast.

Jeffery sees a newspaper. The man killed last night was Peter Minusco. Roger Daniels, govt agent testifies. Roland Marlow is the owner of the club, he got arrested and then let out quietly. 

I read a different paper, the "Emancipator". Garvey in flamboyant costume. Peter Minusco is not mentioned in any story.

Funeral for Frederick Lincoln Fayette brother-in-law, Paradise orchestra leader Charlie Johnson. Funeral is at 11 AM Saturday. Trumpeter is Leeroy Turner.

Lincoln Fayette died by accidental gunshot wound 2 days ago. He was a cab driver. His brother lives in Harlem.

We go to the funeral. Members of the Paradise orchestra are pall bearers.   

Jeffery sees out of the corner of his eye, Leeroy Turner, the trumpeter from last night. In spite of spotting Leeroy, it feels like someone is watching us. A rolling murmur through the crowd, Howard hears a moaning noise from inside the coffin.

Suddenly the pall bearers lurch as the weight shifts in coffin. Lincoln Fayette gets out of the coffin, undead! 

We see the wife of Fayette, Lizzie ask "Is that you?" Fayette throws his head back and gives a terrible scream. Anger in the crowd against Mr. Dupree. I try to medically examine Fayette's body, but am unable to get through the crowd. The police take away Morgan Dupree.

We go with Leeroy Turner to get a drink. None other than Louis Armstrong gave him the trumpet.

I suspect that Turner is holding something back. Armstrong's eyes look like pools of blackness. Howard notices the trumpet has 4 valves instead of 3. Inside the bell of the trumpet are strange symbols.

### Friday July 16 1920 2PM

We go to Peter Minusco's office. The police say he's dead. Howard investigates and finds that all the files under the letter B are gone. Probably connected to rival mob boss Archie "The Boss" Bonato. 

Walking away from the building. Louis Armstrong is playing at Small's Paradise 9PM tonight. 

Peter Minusco lives in the upper west side. We go to visit Minusco's apartment. Door is unlocked. I enter the apartment first. Everything is very clean and in its place. I see an open book on a desk across the room. From this distance it looks like a scrapbook. It contains a bunch of clippings about Archie Bonato. There's an accounting ledger next to the scrapbook.

Jeffery notices monthly cash deposits of $1000 for a period of about a year to Archie's. The scrapbook contains article clippings about Archie over the past year. We take the scrapbook and the ledger. 

I take a clip of $120. We mess up the place to make it look like a robbery happened. Jeffery and Howard hit each other and take damage. 

### Friday July 16 1920 6PM

We go to Small's Paradise and chats up the barkeep. We buy a round of drinks. We learn that the Charlie Johnson's brother Irrelevant died and his wife Marnie died this past year. Jeffery goes to the kitchen, he encounters Ed the 6'6" chef. He makes a pasta carbonara, everyone likes the carbonara. 

### Friday July 16 1920 8PM

Ed the cook comes out to give Jeffery a nod, to indicate the music act is here. Jeffery looks over Louis but doesn't hear what he's been whispering. Jeffery asks Louis whether he gave Leeroy a trumpet, Louis says he didn't.

After Jeffery gets back to the bar, Leeroy suddenly runs out across club. We follow him out onto the street, we see Leeroy get shoved into the white packard that Joey Larson got into earlier. We hail a cab and order the driver to follow the car. While our drive is initially suspicious, Jeffery pulls out a gun and intimidates the driver. 

We follow the packard to the edge of Haarlem, lots of vacant lots, next to the Hudson River. Jeffery pays the driver $10 (the fare is $0.30). He attempts to threaten the driver to stay. The driver is too intimidated and speeds off immediately after we get out. 

We see trucks go into an old garage, we assume Archie Bonato is using the garage is using it as an exchange point. There's a derelict office. We see through the window that Leeroy Turner has been tied to a chair in the office. Joey Larson hands him a trumpet. There are 4 other thugs. Jeffery recognizes that Archie Bonato is present. Bonato asks Larson "is this the boy?" Larson says yes. Bonato asks Larson to repeat his story. Larson tells him the story of how he saw Turner bring Lincoln Fayette back to life at the funeral.

Bonato berates Larson for an earlier failure and orders him to shoot himself. Larson refuses. Bonato orders "Little Jimmy" to shoot Larson. Little Jimmy tries to, Larson pulls his gun, Bonato shoots him first. Bonato orders Turner to start playing. Larson's body returns to life and spits blood. It lunges at Bonato. Little Jimmy opens his Tommy gun, the body is still able to keep dancing. Turner is clearly going insane. We all lose our sanity.

Bonato orders Turner is brought to the basement of Mama Shang Bells a brothel in Harlem. As the packard is driving away we see Turner roll out of the back of the car and run away from the car and into Harlem. 

### Saturday July 17 1920 3AM

We realize that Turner may be running towards his dead girlfriend Marnie. We get into a taxi and ask the driver to go to the Trinity cemetary. 

We run into a groundskeeper in the cemetary who tells us where Marnie is buried. As we take the path towards Marnie, we see Turner rush in and starts playing the trumpet.

The undead crawl out of the ground all around us. Jeffery and I are both fast enough to run ahead of the zombies. Howard dodges two zombies. Jeffery attempts to shoot Turner in the head, misses and gets grabbed on the arm by one zombie, the zombie scratches Jeffery's face. I keep running towards Turner, pointing at Jeffery and calling out his name to the zombies. Howard attempts to pretend to be a zombie and shuffles towards Jeffery. Jeffery is thrown to the ground by a zombie, but throws off the zombie.  

Jeffery goes insane and becomes a necrophiliac. I shoot Turner, but do not kill him. I talk Turner down and he drops the trumpet. Howard takes the trumpet. Jeffery attempts to grab Howard, but Howard dodges.
