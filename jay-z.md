## Notes

###Thursday July 15 1920 10PM###

A fellow alumni at Cornell has informed me that a professor there requires my services. We are to meet at a bar, Small's Paradise, in Harlem on 135th St. 

Admitted by the doorman. Directed to a table in the back of the club. Food is genuine and imported. Swankest place in town, plenty of bribes keep it open.    

We are seated at a table where a man is sitting at a table, but not the man I expect. He tells us the person we are supposed to be meeting is not present.

Fail to notice anything about the man watching the jazz band or spot anything hidden.

A man carrying a shiny trumpet enters the room. He seems to want to get to the band but we are on the way. He walks up to the stranger we are seated with. 

Notice the trumpter, named Turner, had some drinks. Jeffery asks turner to play something.

Announcement: "Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor is here..." New song, dead man stomp. New piece is a hit.

I notice a small rat-like man has entered the room. Not sure if he's headed towards us or will pass by. Midway through the tribute to the mayor, the stranger moves forward.

Rat-faced man blows the head off the stranger.

Jeffery, his goon, and I chase after the man outside. He gets in a Packard (car) and drive off. Jeffery takes a shot at the car. Someone pops up in the car and sprays a Thompson SMG. I get shot in the leg.

I do first aid on myself to stop the bleeding.

We go back inside, the stranger gets up and staggers out of a club even though he has a hole in his head. As he leaves the club, screams mark his progress. 

The undead stranger keeps moaning "Joey". After he goes outside, cops arrive, and we go with Jeffery back to Comet Pizzeria. The goon

After arriving at Pizzeria, the goon comes back and gives us a card:

Morgan and Dupree Funeral Home / 145th St Harlem. Serving families of African descent since 1851. 

We stay the night at Jeffery the Egg's place. 

###Friday July 16 1920 9AM###

I wake up and go to work, cheerfully helping others. 

Unbeknownst to me, Howard calls his Cornell professor friend. The professor says the undead man was "moved by the music". 

The goon recognizes the rat-faced man as Joey Larson from Archie "The Boss" Bonato's gang.

Howard and Jeffery pick me up. We go get breakfast.

Jeffery sees a newspaper. The man killed last night was Peter Minusco. Roger Daniels, govt agent testifies. Roland Marlow is the owner of the club, he got arrested and then let out quietly. 

I read a different paper, the "Emancipator". Garvey in flamboyant costume. Peter Minusco is not mentioned in any story.

Funeral for Frederick Lincoln Fayette brother-in-law, Paradise orchestra leader Charlie Johnson. Funeral is at 11 AM Saturday. Trumpeter is Leeroy Turner.

Lincoln Fayette died by accidental gunshot wound 2 days ago. He was a cab driver. His brother lives in Harlem.

We go to the funeral. Members of the Paradise orchestra are pall bearers.   

Jeffery sees out of the corner of his eye, Leeroy Turner, the trumpeter from last night. In spite of spotting Leeroy, it feels like someone is watching us. A rolling murmur through the crowd, Howard hears a moaning noise from inside the coffin.

Suddenly the pall bearers lurch as the weight shifts in coffin. Lincoln Fayette gets out of the coffin, undead! 

We see the wife of Fayette, Lizzie ask "Is that you?" Fayette throws his head back and gives a terrible scream. Anger in the crowd against Mr. Dupree. I try to medically examine Fayette's body, but am unable to get through the crowd. The police take away Morgan Dupree.

We go with Leeroy Turner to get a drink. None other than Louis Armstrong gave him the trumpet.

I suspect that Turner is holding something back. Armstrong's eyes look like pools of blackness. Howard notices the trumpet has 4 valves instead of 3. Inside the bell of the trumpet are strange symbols.

###Friday July 16 1920 2PM###

We go to Peter Minusco's office. The police say he's dead. Howard investigates and finds that all the files under the letter B are gone. Probably connected to rival mob boss Archie "The Boss" Bonato.
