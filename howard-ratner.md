## Backstory

### Personal Description

I was born into wealth, my parents were New York socialites. When I was Developed addictions to alcohol, opium and gambling during my 20s. I "overcame" my chemical vices but I now gamble professionally, for my "patrons". After a shocking event, I developed an interest in the occult and prefer the company of my studies to that of other humans.
 
### Traits

* Gambler and a risk taker

### Ideology / Beliefs

* Belief in a higher power. I long to see once again the dark power I witnessed years ago. 

### Injuries & Scars


### Significant People

* My friend Charlie taught me everything about gambling. He took a liking to me when he learned how much money my parents had. Charlie was the fastest talker around, he could get anyone to believe anything. He taught me that too. Came in handy when I had to convince the law that it was him cheating the casino and not me. It's a damn shame too, we could have had a real go of it as partners...

### Phobias & Manias

* fear of mirrors
* excessive liking for solitude

### Meaningful Locations

* I still own the townhouse that I grew up in. I live there now that my parents are dead. That townhouse was where I first found love. My friend Chadwick had brought something called "opium" and soon I was wrapped in a warm loving blanket of static, oblivious to my exernal world. I had never felt such a thing, and I knew I had found my first true love. 

### Arcane Tomes, Spells & Artifacts


### Treasured Possessions

* A magnifying glass that I use to read


### Ecounters with Strange Entities

* When I was around 20 years of age, I was brought to a social gathering at a villa upstate by my parents. They wanted me to prevent me from doing opium while they were away. While there, after doing some opium, I wandered to a secluded part of property where I heard noises. A gentleman there told me to leave, but I stuck past. What I witnessed haunts me to this day. A devilish ritual -- writhing limbs and masks made out to resemble terrible beasts. It was here where I encountered something otherworldly, a deep horror that I cannot put to words. I was never caught, but I soon distanced myself from my family's social circles as I followed my research into the occult.
