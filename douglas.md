## Backstory

I grew up in Boston in a middle class community had a fairly normal upbringing when I was a child I accidently killed my child hood friend with an axe. For years after I was afraid of the forest and the beautiful plants that live with in it, I went to school at Boston College, and was originally a journalism student however, one weekend while on a mushroom trip I realized that I needed to throw myself into the most important of all sciences, Botany. It is the only way we can make sure that we can make sure that farming stays sustainable and keep us safe from the evils of the pharmaceutical companies that have taken over our medical system with their brain altering and dangerous vaccines. After completing my masters in botany, I transferred to the university of Vermont to complete my doctorate but had not realized that they were also a infernal medical school teaching breeding terrifying doctors like rats on a ship. So I left and became a lumberjack based out of Swanton, I herd of a group of free minded individuals living on an island in lake Champlain so I decided to join them as they would let me explore the full depths of my botanical knowledge as well as live the free and unhindered life Iâ€™ve always wanted. I have been here for several years and am now a right hand to our glorious leader.  I grow some of the meditational herbs we sell to help make us money and use my botany skills to make us beer and other hallucinogenic materials for our rituals.
