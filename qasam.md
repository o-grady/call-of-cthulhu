## Backstory

### Personal Description

I am Qasam, heir to the ancient and noble House of Soleimani. For many years I tended to my family's estates and travelling across the lands that used to comprise the now fallen Ottoman Empire... That is until my idiot son was tricked by cursed men of Wall Street to gamble away our family fortune on vile CAMELS! Now I have come to America to seek revenge for my family...

### Traits

I want to seduce the wives of the Wall Street robber barons who tricked my idiot son into buying those godforsaken camel futures. I will convince these women to poison their husbands and sign control of their estates to ME. Gradually I will build a harem and financial empire to purchase wall street and secure vengeance for the House of Soleimani.

### Ideology / Beliefs

Even since the corrupt dealings between those Yankee financiers and my useless man-child of an eldest, I am certain such malignant cysts on family and society not be allowed to spread. Only through eugenics can we contain the advance of evil and create an innocent society, truly free and pure.

### Injuries & Scars

### Significant People

I am driven to prove the House of Soleimani is better than my shit-tier idiot son Mahmoud who gambled away the family fortune on useless camel futures. All on aspirations lie with my youngest, Aliya, beautiful, quick-witted, and beloved by all. For now, what little remains of the Soleimani fortune are safe in her capable hands.

### Phobias & Manias

parasitophobia (like my son)
achluomania (I LOVE the dark)

### Meaningful Locations

The beautiful scenic coastal city of Aden where I was born and my family still lives.

### Arcane Tomes, Spells & Artifacts

### Treasured Possessions

Signed original copy of the Descent of Man by Darwin

Saturday 10AM

Buy 2 lamps, 2.60. 1 loaf of bread, .25, 1 bushel of apples .02. 1 crow bar, 2.25.

-5.12 for stuff.

Acquired 3 bicycles by stealing.

Old town is rotting away, 40 people. Church, gas station, general store, milk depot.

General store

Klaus and Bernando refill water bottle and 5 vials with water. Reed plants Tumolia Lauren disappeared last night.

Saturday 1PM

Go to farm house.

Notice a decomposing racoon carcass. Klaus turns it over with a stick. Raccoon's heart has been scooped out.

Logs that need to be dried.

Make our way over to the barn. Got a shovel.

Go into house. Go into cellar. Man attacked. Red Julian was hunted by a monster.

Letter from Marion Allen. Took the robes. Cigar box containing dust. Smaller box containing talcum like powder.

On papers: Oh spirit... when the draw all their ... Nyarhotep ... Exercise ... Hear you and obey

Draw a pentagram as part of the ritual?

Saturday 9PM

Klaus peeked into attic. Got aced by monster, hurt self falling down. Limped our way back to town.

On arrival in town, try to go to the house above general store. Got in trouble. Played the game of shovels, both Qasam and Bernardo got hit. Spent the night in jail.

Sunday 9AM

Bernando tries to command Fernando the monkey to get the keys, however Fernando is distracted by a cat. 

We try to cry for help, but no one hears. Fernando returns. Fernando gets the keys. We use the keys to let ourselves out. 

Klaus looks around the jail cell and finds a revolver. Klaus gives the revolver to me.

Sunday 10AM 

We walk to the farm house.

Sunday 12PM

Return to the farm house. Our bikes are still there.

We draw the pentagram.

Sunday 1PM

We prepare for the ritual. I find a nice bottle of liqor. Bernardo finds some medicinal herbs. Klaus finds the body of Red Julian, he has a similar chest wound to the others.

Bernardo inspects the wound and finds Red is also missing a heart.

Sunday 3PM 

We move the logs into the sun to dry. 

Sunday 9:30PM

The wood is dry. Pentagram remains intact. We're still in our robes. Klaus has spilled some alcohol on himself.

Sunday 12AM

Start fire,  Start chanting. Acid is oozing from the ceiling through the walls. It touches no one.

I hear the faint screaming of the woman who introduced me to Rupert Merriweather. I ignore it because it sounds wrong and otherwordly. 

The body of Tumoliya rises and starts banging on a window. Klaus shoots the body in the head and its head explodes, splattering over the window.

The body of Red Julian rises and starts banging on another window. While distracted, acid drips on Klaus' head and as a result, he misses his shot. I take one of Klaus' pistols and shoot Red Julian.

Monday 1:30AM

The undead raccoon falls through the trapdoor. Klaus attempts to attack the raccoon but misses and the raccoon latches itself to Klaus' face. Fernando the monkey attacks the raccoon and manages to pull it off of Klaus' face. 

The figure of my damned son appears inside the pentagram. I yell at him that I know the figure is not my son because my son is even more stupid looking than the figure, and my real son needs to be removed from the genepool. I throw the other dust and a larger monster appears around, with grotesque talons and claws.

To Bernardo, the figure inside looks like his former lover Fernando (the priest). This causes Bernardo to go insane, stop chanting, remove all his clothes, and crawl towards the demonic figure. Klaus manages to restrain Bernardo by the ankles. 

My son turns to me and tells me, in an otherworldly voice, that he knows the secrets that will bring down the Street of Walls Barons. I shoot three times into the ceiling in rage. The monster takes that as a refusal.

Monday 2:30AM

Inside the box is a small piece of amber. 

We remove the runes, burn the remaining bodies. Bike back to Arkham, avoiding Ross's Corners.

Tuesday

Return to Arkham, visit a realtor to put the house up for sale. Man in a bowler hat waddles up to us. Asks us if we know Rupert Merriweather. Yes, the man has Rupert's will. Rupert leaves us an Oldsmobile.

We drive to NYC. We have returned to our jobs.
