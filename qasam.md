## Backstory

### Personal Description

I am Qasam, heir to the ancient and noble House of Soleimani. For many years I tended to my family's estates and travelling across the lands that used to comprise the now fallen Ottoman Empire... That is until my idiot son was tricked by cursed men of Wall Street to gamble away our family fortune on vile CAMELS! Now I have come to America to seek revenge for my family...

### Traits

I want to seduce the wives of the Wall Street robber barons who tricked my idiot son into buying those godforsaken camel futures. I will convince these women to poison their husbands and sign control of their estates to ME. Gradually I will build a harem and financial empire to purchase wall street and secure vengeance for the House of Soleimani.

### Ideology / Beliefs

Even since the corrupt dealings between those Yankee financiers and my useless man-child of an eldest, I am certain such malignant cysts on family and society not be allowed to spread. Only through eugenics can we contain the advance of evil and create an innocent society, truly free and pure.

### Injuries & Scars

### Significant People

I am driven to prove the House of Soleimani is better than my shit-tier idiot son Mahmoud who gambled away the family fortune on useless camel futures. All on aspirations lie with my youngest, Aliya, beautiful, quick-witted, and beloved by all. For now, what little remains of the Soleimani fortune are safe in her capable hands.

### Phobias & Manias

parasitophobia (like my son)
achluomania (I LOVE the dark)

### Meaningful Locations

The beautiful scenic coastal city of Aden where I was born and my family still lives.

### Arcane Tomes, Spells & Artifacts

### Treasured Possessions

Signed original copy of the Descent of Man by Darwin

### Ecounters with Strange Entities

## Gear and Possessions

## Cash and Assets

**Spending Level**: 10

**Cash**: 28

**Assets**: 70 camels
