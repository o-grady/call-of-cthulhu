## Backstory

### Personal Description

I'm Beau. I'm an investigative journalist. I'm truly inspired by my dear father Seosamh, who is a very important layer. He is everything to me. I covered the Great War and saw combat (from a distance). My father told me how brave I was. You'll either find me wandering alone or in the company of one of my many female "acquaintances". 

### Traits
My daddy once said that "that boy Beau, he.... he's like a rabbit. He -- he just loves the ladies. You know -- back in my day you'd have to go to the square dance and tell a dame that you fancied here... It's so--- so different with B-b-b-Beau. I'm so proud of my only son, he'll give me so m-m-m-many little grandchildren. You know... kids they love old Joe. I just could eat them up..."

### Ideology / Beliefs 
Strong belief in God. It upsets my that my father has lost his way.

### Injuries & Scars

### Significant People
My daddy joe is everything to me. After every other member of my family died in a tragic horse and buggy accident, he's all I have left. I don't know how I'd go on without him. 

### Phobias & Manias
I am rightfully terrified of firearms.

I often prefer my own company and will choose that over the company of most others.

### Meaningful Locations
I just love Delaware. Golly, it's the greatest state in the union, that's what my daddy always said. 

### Arcane Tomes, Spells & Artifacts

### Treasured Possessions
I have a so called "black book" with information gathered through my carrer as a journalise. I have found it to be very persuasive... 

### Encounters with Strange Entities

## Gear and Possessions
