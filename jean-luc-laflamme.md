## Backstory

### Personal Description
I am Jean-Luc Laflamme, a Hunter from Skowhegan, Maine. My family dates back to New France and fur trapping is in by background. My father taught me how to live off the land, and instilled a deep distrust of the government and institutions. I currently live on an island on lake Champlain where I serve the leader of my community. 

It was here were I became spiritually awakened, taken on a journey that transcends space, time and consciousness itself. While on this journey, I felt that I lived an entire life that was not my own. I had a family, I grew old. I learned to play the flute. The experience was so real to me that the sound of a flute in the real world strikes a deep sense of dread in my heart, as I long for my family that does not exist. 

When I'm not out tracking, you'll find my at Rasputin's bar in town in Burlington. It's one of the few bars that allows me to bring my dog.
