## Backstory

### Personal Description

I was born in Albany in 1893. My loving mother passed away in my youth and since then, my father has never forgiven God. When I was 21, the War To End All Wars broke out in Europe. At the time, I couldn't find my own arse with two hands but after reading about the Rape of Belgium at the hands of the Huns, and hearing what Teddy Roosevelt had to say in the election of '16, I was convinced. America must fight for the ideals of our Founders at home and Abroad. We must bring the Peace of Righteousness to Europe, even if those hyphenated Americans supporting neutrality put their loyalties to Ireland and Germany ahead of America. 

I enlisted in the Army as soon as war was declared in Spring 1917. I arrived in France that autumn with the 1st Infantry division. With my new found brothers-in-arms, we defended Paris from the onslaught of the Huns through the spring of 1918. The war was a never ending horror show and, I will admit, I often yearned to be back home in Albany. But my duty to my brothers and my country came first. The division captured Soissons in July and I earned my promotion to Corporal. When we cleared the St-Mihiel salient in September, I earned my promotion to Sergeant. By November, the Division came within 7 miles of the Meuse river. This was the most brutal fighting in the war. I gained a respect for Fritz and a purple heart in exchange for my left eye. I spent the remainder of the war in a military hospital.

I returned home to Albany in October 1919, forever changed by the war.

### Traits

Ambitious: After the horrors I saw in France, I aspire to hold the traitor Woodrow Wilson accountable and pursue the revival of the Progressive Party, perhaps with a leading role for myself.

### Ideology / Beliefs 

Campaigner/Activist: While I was inspired by Teddy Roosevelt to enlist, the futile destruction I witnessed in Europe has made me realize that Robert La Follette was right all along. The financial interests of the US and other Allied Powers will inevitably destroy the League of Nations and bring about an even more devastating war. 

### Injuries & Scars

Missing left eye, wears an eye-patch.

### Significant People

I want to prove myself better than my brother. I went to fight the Great War, and all my brother did was report on the war! He got to stay out of harm's way and keep both of his eyes. The bastard was born in Arkansas and acts like he hit a triple. 

### Phobias & Manias

Fear of fur: In the village of St-Juvin during the Meuse offensive, I nearly suffocated to death under a stuffed trophy bear after a shell collapsed the rest of the house above me.

Obsession with sharp or pointed objects: During the ennui of trench warfare, I developed an obsession playing with my bayonet.

### Meaningful Locations

A place for quiet contemplation: The Graceland Cemetery outside Albany where I walk between the head stones. 

### Arcane Tomes, Spells & Artifacts

### Treasured Possessions

A weapon: my Colt M1911 .45 pistol
