## Backstory
I was born in Tsaritsyn in 1899 to a poor family of fishermen. I was raised on the docks spending my days chasing rats for fun and working tirelessly to gut the fish as they came in from the boat, this is where I learned my skills with a knife. When I was 14 my fathers boat sunk as sea and he drowned three days later my mother was hit and killed by the new tram on its inaugural run through the city. The blood of my parents was used to grease the wheel of capitalism. I was a fervent reader of Pravda from the beginning of its publication and was inspired by the words of Trotsky. I was drafted into the army during WWI and but when the revolution began, I joined at the first opportunity. After the revolution I joined the NKVD as an assassin and have sience been working my way up the ranks removing obstacles to the states success when ever needed.
