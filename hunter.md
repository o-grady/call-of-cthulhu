## Backstory

### Personal Description

I was born in Albany in 1893. My loving mother passed away in my youth and since then, my father has never forgiven God. When I was 21, the War To End All Wars broke out in Europe. At the time, I couldn't find my own arse with two hands but after reading about the Rape of Belgium at the hands of the Huns, and hearing what Teddy Roosevelt had to say in the election of '16, I was convinced. America must fight for the ideals of our Founders at home and Abroad. We must bring the Peace of Righteousness to Europe, even if those hyphenated Americans supporting neutrality put their loyalties to Ireland and Germany ahead of America. 

I enlisted in the Army as soon as war was declared in Spring 1917. I arrived in France that autumn with the 1st Infantry division. With my new found brothers-in-arms, we defended Paris from the onslaught of the Huns through the spring of 1918. The war was a never ending horror show and, I will admit, I often yearned to be back home in Albany. But my duty to my brothers and my country came first. The division captured Soissons in July and I earned my promotion to Corporal. When we cleared the St-Mihiel salient in September, I earned my promotion to Sergeant. By November, the Division came within 7 miles of the Meuse river. This was the most brutal fighting in the war. I gained a respect for Fritz and a purple heart in exchange for my left eye. I spent the remainder of the war in a military hospital.

I returned home to Albany in October 1919, forever changed by the war.

### Traits

Ambitious: After the horrors I saw in France, I aspire to hold the traitor Woodrow Wilson accountable and pursue the revival of the Progressive Party, perhaps with a leading role for myself.

### Ideology / Beliefs 

Campaigner/Activist: While I was inspired by Teddy Roosevelt to enlist, the futile destruction I witnessed in Europe has made me realize that Robert La Follette was right all along. The financial interests of the US and other Allied Powers will inevitably destroy the League of Nations and bring about an even more devastating war. 

### Injuries & Scars

Missing left eye, wears an eye-patch.

### Significant People

I want to prove myself better than my brother. I went to fight the Great War, and all my brother did was report on the war! He got to stay out of harm's way and keep both of his eyes. The bastard was born in Delaware and acts like he hit a triple. 

### Phobias & Manias

Fear of fur: In the village of St-Juvin during the Meuse offensive, I nearly suffocated to death under a stuffed trophy bear after a shell collapsed the rest of the house above me.

Obsession with sharp or pointed objects: During the ennui of trench warfare, I developed an obsession playing with my bayonet.

### Meaningful Locations

A place for quiet contemplation: The Graceland Cemetery outside Albany where I walk between the head stones. 

### Arcane Tomes, Spells & Artifacts

### Treasured Possessions

A weapon: my Colt M1911 .45 pistol

## Notes

### Sunday October 1st 1922

Bryce Kennedy calls on the phone. Joe answers. Bryce is now the dean at Miskatonic University. He's asking we come over to solve the incident. We pack up my survival gear, Dad's guns, and head off in the car.

We arrive at Miskatonic University. Enter the office of Bryce Kennedy. Weird stuff happening. Track down something. School received a generous donation of artifacts. Expert investigating the artifacts was found dead. In the confusion, some of the artifacts went missing. Want us to track down the artifacts. Troubled young man. Expert in antiquities. Locate the witch trial papers. 

Where is the body of the deceased? In the medical school. Remaining artifacts are in the office of Professor Ned Snowden. Artifacts came from the estate of the late Alan Dershowitz. We are given a key to Professor Snowden's office and told he lives above the bookstore.  

Go to Professor Snowden's office, open the door. Amelia Core is in the office. Research assistant. Found Snowden's body and noticed the missing artifacts. Door was locked from the inside. He was found passed out in front of the mirror. Papers and money strewn about. Witchcraft trail documents were the most valuable. No strange visitor visitors. But Snowden was acting erratic. Body found on September 24th. We will be able to find Amelia in the office. Look around, don't find anything. Amelia says Professor Snowden keeps a lot of stuff at home. There are some burned remains of documents in the fire place. Amelia says Snowden was controversial, had quirks. Professor Assange would have really enjoyed working on it. 

Arrive at the university medical school. Directed by the secretary to the morgue. Flag down a man, Dr Wheatcroft, over 60, lost weight recently, sickly. Joe removes the sheet. Professor Snowden's face is frozen in a scream. Eyes look like it's been boiled in the body. I hear an echoing in the room next to our room, like a tapping of light footsteps, but I don't see anyone in the other room. When I heard it the doctor also heard it. I ask the doctor what happened to Snowden. Massive heart attack, body suffered a violent, eyes were boiled. All organs failed immediately. Even gut flora is dead. Wheatcroft feels bad about keeping the whole thing hush-hush. We run into Amelia on our way out and Pa invites her to dinner, but he keeps calling it lunch.

Meanwhile, Beau arrives at the office of Professor Assange to "interview" him as a "journalist". Assange reveals he is finalizing a draft of a new book on the Arkham witch trials, after which Assange hopes for tenure. Assange claims Snowden stole from the university and his artifacts are forgeries. 

We run into each other on campus and go to dinner together. Pa identifies a Luigi's Pizza. We go to dinner. Share stories. Amelia reveals she found a receipt from Snowden for changing the locks. At dinner, Anthony walks up to our table, attempts to sit with us. Joe Biden tries to do a push-up contest with Anthony and loses. Anthony leaves.

We go to a bed and breakfast that Amelia recommends. We sleep opposite ends on one queen bed. I bring the car around and hide the guns in a closet.
