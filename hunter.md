## Backstory

### Personal Description

I was born in Albany in 1893. My loving mother passed away in my youth and since then, my father has never forgiven God. When I was 21, the War To End All Wars broke out in Europe. At the time, I couldn't find my own arse with two hands but after reading about the Rape of Belgium at the hands of the Huns, and hearing what Teddy Roosevelt had to say in the election of '16, I was convinced. America must fight for the ideals of our Founders at home and Abroad. We must bring the Peace of Righteousness to Europe, even if those hyphenated Americans supporting neutrality put their loyalties to Ireland and Germany ahead of America. 

I enlisted in the Army as soon as war was declared in Spring 1917. I arrived in France that autumn with the 1st Infantry division. With my new found brothers-in-arms, we defended Paris from the onslaught of the Huns through the spring of 1918. The war was a never ending horror show and, I will admit, I often yearned to be back home in Albany. But my duty to my brothers and my country came first. The division captured Soissons in July and I earned my promotion to Corporal. When we cleared the St-Mihiel salient in September, I earned my promotion to Sergeant. By November, the Division came within 7 miles of the Meuse river. This was the most brutal fighting in the war. I gained a respect for Fritz and a purple heart in exchange for my left eye. I spent the remainder of the war in a military hospital.

I returned home to Albany in October 1919, forever changed by the war.

### Traits

Ambitious: After the horrors I saw in France, I aspire to hold the traitor Woodrow Wilson accountable and pursue the revival of the Progressive Party, perhaps with a leading role for myself.

### Ideology / Beliefs 

Campaigner/Activist: While I was inspired by Teddy Roosevelt to enlist, the futile destruction I witnessed in Europe has made me realize that Robert La Follette was right all along. The financial interests of the US and other Allied Powers will inevitably destroy the League of Nations and bring about an even more devastating war. 

### Injuries & Scars

Missing left eye, wears an eye-patch.

### Significant People

I want to prove myself better than my brother. I went to fight the Great War, and all my brother did was report on the war! He got to stay out of harm's way and keep both of his eyes. The bastard was born in Delaware and acts like he hit a triple. 

### Phobias & Manias

Fear of fur: In the village of St-Juvin during the Meuse offensive, I nearly suffocated to death under a stuffed trophy bear after a shell collapsed the rest of the house above me.

Obsession with sharp or pointed objects: During the ennui of trench warfare, I developed an obsession playing with my bayonet.

### Meaningful Locations

A place for quiet contemplation: The Graceland Cemetery outside Albany where I walk between the head stones. 

### Arcane Tomes, Spells & Artifacts

### Treasured Possessions

A weapon: my Colt M1911 .45 pistol

## Notes

### Sunday October 1st 1922

Bryce Kennedy calls on the phone. Joe answers. Bryce is now the dean at Miskatonic University. He's asking we come over to solve the incident. We pack up my survival gear, Dad's guns, and head off in the car.

We arrive at Miskatonic University. Enter the office of Bryce Kennedy. Weird stuff happening. Track down something. School received a generous donation of artifacts. Expert investigating the artifacts was found dead. In the confusion, some of the artifacts went missing. Want us to track down the artifacts. Troubled young man. Expert in antiquities. Locate the witch trial papers. 

Where is the body of the deceased? In the medical school. Remaining artifacts are in the office of Professor Ned Snowden. Artifacts came from the estate of the late Alan Dershowitz. We are given a key to Professor Snowden's office and told he lives above the bookstore.  

Go to Professor Snowden's office, open the door. Amelia Core is in the office. Research assistant. Found Snowden's body and noticed the missing artifacts. Door was locked from the inside. He was found passed out in front of the mirror. Papers and money strewn about. Witchcraft trail documents were the most valuable. No strange visitor visitors. But Snowden was acting erratic. Body found on September 24th. We will be able to find Amelia in the office. Look around, don't find anything. Amelia says Professor Snowden keeps a lot of stuff at home. There are some burned remains of documents in the fire place. Amelia says Snowden was controversial, had quirks. Professor Assange would have really enjoyed working on it. 

Arrive at the university medical school. Directed by the secretary to the morgue. Flag down a man, Dr Wheatcroft, over 60, lost weight recently, sickly. Joe removes the sheet. Professor Snowden's face is frozen in a scream. Eyes look like it's been boiled in the body. I hear an echoing in the room next to our room, like a tapping of light footsteps, but I don't see anyone in the other room. When I heard it the doctor also heard it. I ask the doctor what happened to Snowden. Massive heart attack, body suffered a violent, eyes were boiled. All organs failed immediately. Even gut flora is dead. Wheatcroft feels bad about keeping the whole thing hush-hush. We run into Amelia on our way out and Pa invites her to dinner, but he keeps calling it lunch.

Meanwhile, Beau arrives at the office of Professor Assange to "interview" him as a "journalist". Assange reveals he is finalizing a draft of a new book on the Arkham witch trials, after which Assange hopes for tenure. Assange claims Snowden stole from the university and his artifacts are forgeries. 

We run into each other on campus and go to dinner together. Pa identifies a Luigi's Pizza. We go to dinner. Share stories. Amelia reveals she found a receipt from Snowden for changing the locks. At dinner, Anthony walks up to our table, attempts to sit with us. Joe Biden tries to do a push-up contest with Anthony and loses. Anthony leaves.

We go to a bed and breakfast that Amelia recommends. We sleep opposite ends on one queen bed. I bring the car around and hide the guns in a closet.

### Monday October 2nd 1922

It's morning. Joe Biden got up in the middle of the night and slept in the cafe of the bed and breakfast. We decide to try to break into Snowden's house. Joe goes into the store and starts talking to the shopkeeper. Beau tries to pick the lock but does not succeed. Joe bullshits the store clerk into giving him a spare key. We unlock the door and go up together. The apartment is in a state of semi-organized chaos. Snowden was clearly preparing to leave. We entered a front room, a fire place, and stairs that lead to other parts of the house. 

Beau looks at the fireplace and finds some hastily burned pages, with the words: tonight, date, Illaria, and snake in the corner. There is a business document with a proposal of some sort with a signature and the word "wick". Beau goes into the study and finds a notebook that looks like an account ledger. We're not sure what the numbers mean but they are large, probably beyond a university professor's means. The amounts coming in are slightly larger than what's going out. Joe searches the desk and finds some travel tickets and receipts for numerous trips to Atlantic City. Unopened letter sitting on the corner of the desk. We open the envelope, inside is a letter from the local sanatorium. It's a letter of admission, notifying Ned Snowden that a person named Seth Rich has been admitted and Snowden has assumed guardianship over Seth. While circling the desk, we feel one of the floorboards under the desk is loose and sounds hollow. We pry open the board, find a clip for $1000 and a bundle of loose papers that appear to be partial documents, appears to be a partial copy of manuscripts. 

A strong gust of wind hits the apartment and blows papers on the ground and things get knocked off the shelf. Cornpop the dog growls. I pull my gun and advance towards the stairs going up. Beau runs out and Joe is following behind me. At the top of the stairs, there's two rooms. We enter the first room, find a train ticket for Atlantic City and a single earring. The next room is empty and appears to be empty. Last room is a bathroom. Joe takes off the top of the toilet to see if there's anything in the toilet, there's a poker chip with a B. 

We hear footsteps upstairs in the master bedroom, return up the stairs. After opening the door, a strong gust of wind knocks Joe down the stairs and he splits his head is bleeding. I look around the room and nothing appears to be disturbed, the wind only affected us. 

Beau is on the quad with Amelia. We show the documents to Amelia. She says they appear to be forgeries.

Amelia heard Snowden mention the name Illaria on the phone with the Snake Roadhouse. 

We go to the infirmary. The nurse patches up Joe. Beau throws me under the bus and nearly gets me committed. 

It's late afternoon, we arrive at Snake's Roadhouse. 

Seated at the back by Illaria. Find out Illaria and Snowden were going to elope. Illaria tells us Ned owed money to people because of his blackjack addiction. Business card for Abner Wick. We promise Illaria to help her see Snowden's body.

We are followed out of the speakeasy. Two men approach us. We attempt to run them over, but fail. They approach us again, I draw my gun, they draw their guns. Beau talks us down and negotiates with the two men. We find out that they're after Ned's money. 

We return to the bed and breakfast and retire for the night.

### Tuesday October 3rd 1922

Arrive at the Arkham Sanatorium. Tell the receptionist I'm here for an appointment, say a doctor at the university infirmary made an appointment for me here. Receptionist says Dr Armitage will be right out. Joe tries to bullshit the receptionist into a meeting with Seth Rich. Armitage picks us up, we go to his office. He asks me about France, I tell him about it. Joe and Beau go outside to talk to Armitage. Beau talks about obsession with guns and Armitage defends the Second Amendment. Joe starts to bullshit to buy time. I search the room and find a file on Seth in the filing cabinet, I stuff the papers in my pants. After Armitage comes back to the office with Joe and Beau. We go to see Seth. Armitage leaves us in the room.

I back up against the door and take the papers out of my pants and start reading. File, admissions form, September 17 after a profound nervous breakdown. Chewed through the tendons on the back of his own hand. Responding well to medication, but phases in and out. Recites fractured lines of Edgar Allen Poe. Form was signed by a former tutor, Snowden, who found Seth at his home.

Snowden: Dead man he saw them and they saw him. Angels all pallid and blonde. Man its hero the conquerer worm. I recognize the last line from a Poe poem.

Illaria Stone: Seize her next. Waiting tables. Waiting. Worms. 

Dershowitz paper: Her trial, her paper, newborns on her table. 

Poker chip: Money offer, out, not all the way out. Broken geometry. 

Abner Wick: Bad man, eats in his shop. 

There's screeching in the room next door occasionally but no one is in the next room. We leave and run into Armitage on the way out.

We get in the car and head to the library. On our way we run into Bryce Kennedy who asks us whether the mystery can be solved by tomorrow. We run into Amelia who asks us what's going on. She's telling us that Anthony has been going in and out of Snowden's office. We believe Amelia is a witch so Joe bullshits I charm her into following 

Arkham with trials occurred in the 1690s, led by Ahab Dershowitz, an ancestor of Alan Dershowitz. References to an alleged witch, Kirsten Mason. Anthony is sneaking around the library. I tackle him to the ground. We interrogate him, he alleges Bryce Kennedy and Assange and lovers and stole the witch papers. I offend Amelia.

We drive to Snake's Roachhouse. The barkeep tells us Illaria didn't come in for work today. She gives us Illaria's address.

Rope burns around the wrist. Bullet through her forehead. All her money has been taken.

We go to Abner Wick's house. He answers the door. We explain we are looking into Snowden's disappearance. Wick invites us in. He offers us a drink Beau accepts. We discuss Wick's business dealings with Snowden. Wick asks where the body is kept. In reaction, Joe pulls out his gun. The conversation escalates. Wick's apprentices appear in the doorway. The conversation escalates. Joe shoots Wick. The kids attack me, and one grabs my gun and I push off the other. Wick pulls Joe's leg and knocks him over, he hit his head on the table.
